////* Coding Standards *////

script documentation:
	Before you commit your sripts to be tested, you must submit documentation 
	on how to use it and what's required to set it up for testing. This can
	be done via a readme .txt file, or a commented header at the top of your 
	script.

Commenting:
	once a function or some block of your code works and you know what it does,
	comment it.


script names:
	name your scripts in this format:	subject_description_initials
								 e.g.	Player_Stats_sll
										Player_behavior_sll

variable names:
	variables should follow the 
	AIE coding standard.
								i.e.	TYPE	PREFIX		EXAMPLE
										int		  i		    iBullets
										bool	  b			bIsAlive
										float	  f			 fTimer
	These are just some examples. If you need a new variable and aren't sure how it should 
	be named, refer to the pdf before just giving it a name and rolling with it.

Function names:
	Each word should start with a capital letter. Underscores should be used sparingly, only for organizational purposes within your script


Refer to AIE C_C++ Coding Standards.pdf for a more complete list of function and variable name conventions we'll be using.
